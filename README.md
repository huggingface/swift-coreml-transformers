# Swift Core ML implementations of Transformers: GPT-2, DistilGPT-2, BERT, DistilBERT, more coming soon!

This repository contains:
- For **BERT** and **DistilBERT**:
	- pretrained [Google BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) and [Hugging Face DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) models fine-tuned for Question answering on the SQuAD dataset.
	- Swift implementations of the [BERT tokenizer](https://github.com/huggingface/swift-coreml-transformers/blob/master/Sources/BertTokenizer.swift) (`BasicTokenizer` and `WordpieceTokenizer`) and SQuAD dataset parsing utilities.
	- A neat demo question answering app.
- For **GPT-2** and **DistilGPT-2**:
	- a [conversion script](https://github.com/huggingface/swift-coreml-transformers/blob/master/model_generation/gpt2.py) from PyTorch trained GPT-2 models (see our [`transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) repo) to CoreML models.
	- The [GPT-2 generation model](https://github.com/huggingface/swift-coreml-transformers/blob/master/Sources/GPT2.swift) itself, including decoding strategies (greedy and TopK are currently implemented) and GPT-2 Byte-pair encoder and decoder.
	- A neat demo app showcasing on-device text generation.


# ü¶Ñ GPT-2 and DistilGPT-2

Unleash the full power of text generation with GPT-2 on device!!

# üê∏ BERT and DistilBERT

The `BERTSQUADFP16` Core ML model was packaged by Apple and is linked from the [main ML models page](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/#text). It was demoed at WWDC 2019 as part of the Core ML 3 launch.

The `DistilBERT` Core ML models were converted from [`ü§ó/transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) exports using the scripts in this repo.

## Notes

We use `git-lfs` to store large model files and it is required to obtain some of the files the app needs to run.
See how to install `git-lfs`on the [installation page](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
